Actually, my development envrionment was broken when I was developing web application and updating my PC to Windows 11 for a week, ...and suddenly it said 'Goodbye'.
My Windows PC is still Windows 10, definitely I failed updating OS in the fact.

I don't touch Windows PC much except to play games, somehow I want to write codes using by it.
It was 100% a whim. That's why I started restoring the broken environment.

## Reset Ubuntu App

At first, I need to reset Ubuntu application, so do by following these steps.

1. Open the configration menu
2. Go to the App & Functions page
3. Search from the list, you fill `ubuntu` and find ubuntu app from here
4. Click the target application and go to the detail
5. Click the reset

## Renew Ubuntu app

You already reset the old Ubuntu app, so you can create a new one on your PC, it should be the same as to buy new PC. very happy.

1. Open the search window and fill in `ubuntu`
2. Click the application, then start to create new ubuntu app. It's a very easy task
3. Finally, you can check creation of the application
4. Open PowerShell and type `wsl -l -v` then you can see the result as following

```powershell
PS C:\Users\user1> wsl -l -v
  NAME                   STATE          VERSION
* docker-desktop-data    Stopped        2
  docker-desktop         Stopped        2
  Ubuntu                 Running        2
```

If you have time, it's better to change the default distribution to `Ubuntu` because the default of my env was `docker-desktop-data`.

```powershell
wsl --set-default <virtual-environment-name>
```

```powershell
PS C:\Users\user1> wsl --set-default Ubuntu
PS C:\Users\user1> wsl -l -v
  NAME                   STATE          VERSION
* Ubuntu                 Running        2
  docker-desktop         Stopped        2
  docker-desktop-data    Stopped        2
```

The reset process is now completed. So, let's get started to create new environment!

## Set up new environment

### Installation Alacritty

- [alacritty/alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
- https://alacritty.org

You can install the alacritty which is a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults, but allows for extensive configrations.

After installing, you need to set configuration as follows:

1. Execute `Win + R`, and search `%appdata%`
2. Create alacritty directory and also create `alacritty.yml` which is configuration file for alacritty.
3. Configure settings

```yml
# alacritty.yml
shell:
  program: "C:\\Windows\\System32\\wsl.exe ~ -d Ubuntu"
  args:
    - 'zellij attach --index 0 --create'

window:
  dimensions:
    columns: 200
    lines: 60
  padding:
    x: 8
    y: 4
  opacity: 0.95

selection:
  save_to_clipboard: true
```

4. Then, you start up `alacritty` ( Don't forget to install Zellij beforehand. )
